This program is a simple keylogger using the pyxhook package available online.
It is not intended to be malicious. This program should exclusively be used 
for educational purposes, and should NOT be used anywhere you enter personal
data. In fact, all testing of this program should be done by a capable user
on a Virtual Machine.

Execution:

    $> python keylogger.py 

Exit:

    The program will exit once the spacebar has been pressed. Otherwise, it can
    be killed by the standard kill <pid> command. It runs under the "python"
    command name.
