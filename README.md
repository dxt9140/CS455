README

This program is a simple keylogger using the pyxhook package available online.
It is not intended to be malicious. This program should exclusively be used 
for educational purposes, and should NOT be used anywhere you enter personal
data. In fact, all testing of this program should be done by a capable user
on a Virtual Machine.

Execution:

    $> python keylogger.py 

Exit:

    Pressing the esc key ends the program. In a typical run, pressing this key
    then sends the captured keystrokes to the email specified in the Timer
    class. It also appears as a process using the 'ps -a' command, and can be
    killed the violent way.
