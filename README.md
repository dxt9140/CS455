This program is a simple keylogger using the pyxhook package available online.
It is not intended to be malicious. This program should exclusively be used 
for educational purposes, and should NOT be used anywhere you enter personal
data. In fact, all testing of this program should be done by a capable user
on a Virtual Machine.

Execution:

    $> python keylogger.py 

Exit:

    The program will now exit. You should manually exit the program. By using 
    control + C or command + C. If it doesn't work, close terminal or command Prompt.
    I tried to make it quit when user press ESC but there is some bug which we can 
    fix later.
